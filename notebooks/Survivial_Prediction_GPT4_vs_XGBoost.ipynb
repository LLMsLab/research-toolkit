    "# Comparative Analysis of Zero-Shot Learning and Supervised Learning for Titanic Survival Prediction: A Study Using GPT-4 and Tree-based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of Machine Learning and Data Analysis, various strategies exist to solve classification problems. Two commonly utilized methods are zero-shot learning and traditional supervised learning. This analysis aims to compare these approaches, specifically in the context of a tabular data classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset and Classification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task revolves around the Titanic Survival dataset, a well-known set of passenger information from the ill-fated Titanic voyage. It includes a collection of records, each corresponding to a passenger, with manually labeled information such as passenger class, age, sex, and importantly, whether the passenger survived or not. The aim is to create models that can accurately predict the survival of new, unseen passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Titanic Survival Dataset:** This dataset is a famous introductory dataset in machine learning and data science. It contains passenger information from the Titanic shipwreck and is often used for binary classification: survived or not survived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue with Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One significant aspect of many real-world datasets is class imbalance. That is, the number of survivors significantly differs from the number of non-survivors. This imbalance can present challenges in model training, as models may become biased towards predicting the majority class. In our case, a model might lean towards predicting 'not survived' more often as it could still achieve a seemingly high accuracy that way. We will address this issue and present strategies for handling such class imbalances in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Assessment Metrics and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of our models, we use three key metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while Recall (also known as Sensitivity) measures the proportion of true positives that were correctly identified. The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall and gives us a single metric that takes both false positives and false negatives into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is often used as an evaluation metric, which depicts the model's performance across all classification thresholds. However, since we are using the OpenAI API for zero-shot learning, and it does not provide the probability scores needed to compute the AUC, we will not use the AUC in this analysis. This limitation does not impact the efficacy of our comparison as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score offer robust measures to evaluate and compare the performance of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the dataset, problem, challenges, and evaluation metrics defined, our aim is to compare the efficacy of zero-shot learning and traditional supervised learning techniques in solving this tabular data classification problem. This comparison will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and guide us towards the most suitable method for this particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zero-Shot In-Context Learning Using GPT-4 Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of machine learning, in-context learning refers to a method where a model leverages contextual information to generate responses or predictions. In the case of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI, it uses a context window to inform its output based on provided prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our scenario, we employ what is known as zero-shot learning in conjunction with in-context learning. Zero-shot learning is a type of machine learning where the model is asked to make predictions on data categories it has not explicitly seen during training. In other words, the model uses the generalized understanding it has developed during its pre-training phase to make predictions on unseen data. It is an appealing approach, especially in situations where labelled training data for specific tasks might be scarce or unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our task, a tabular data classification problem involving predicting the survival of passengers based on their characteristics, the prompt for zero-shot learning using GPT-4 takes the following general structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "    prompt = (\n",
    "        \"Based on the passenger information, is the passenger most likely to have survived or not survived the Titanic disaster?\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Passenger Information:\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"{feature1_name}: {feature1_value}\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"{feature2_name}: {feature2_value}\\n\"\n",
    "        \"...\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"{featureN_name}: {featureN_value}\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Answer Choices: (A) Survived, (B) Not Survived.\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, 'Survived' corresponds to 'Survived' and 'Not Survived' corresponds to 'Not Survived', and `{feature1_value}`, `{feature2_value}`, ..., `{featureN_value}` represent the passenger's characteristics we want the model to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of zero-shot in-context learning with GPT-4 was evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Each metric provides insights into the model's performance considering both true positives and negatives, and false positives and negatives. Despite the OpenAI API limitations preventing us from calculating the AUC, these metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the zero-shot in-context learning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, zero-shot in-context learning with GPT-4 offers an exciting approach to our tabular data classification task, demonstrating versatility in handling class imbalances, and effectiveness in generalizing without explicit task-related training. However, as we will explore in the following sections, other learning methods can also be applied and compared to this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Python script provided is designed to work with text data. However, since the Titanic dataset is a tabular data set, we need to adapt the code appropriately. Here's an example of how the prompt can be formulated for a zero-shot classification task using the Titanic dataset."

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision:** Precision is the measure of the model's accuracy considering only the predicted positive instances. In the context of our problem, a precision of 0.50 means that when GPT-4 predicts a passenger to have survived, it is correct 50% of the time. This level of precision indicates a relatively high rate of false positive classifications (i.e., passengers predicted as survived but did not actually survive).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recall:** Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. In our scenario, a recall of 1.00 means that the model identifies 100% of all actual 'Survived' instances correctly. However, it also indicates a 0% rate of false negatives (i.e., 'Survived' instances incorrectly classified as 'Did not survive').\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **F1 Score:** The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it gives a balanced measure of these two metrics. An F1 score of 0.67 indicates a balance between precision and recall, demonstrating the model's robustness in handling both false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these results, we can see that the model is perfectly identifying all the actual survivors (Recall = 1.00), but it is only correct half the time when it predicts a passenger has survived (Precision = 0.50). This could be a result of the model's tendency to classify passengers as having survived, leading to a high number of false positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score, which is a balance of precision and recall, is 0.67. This suggests that there's room for improvement, particularly in reducing the number of false positive predictions. Different strategies could be employed to enhance the model's performance, such as fine-tuning the model on the task or collecting more diverse samples for prediction."

    "Here are some strategies you can follow to improve the performance of zero-shot in-context learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improve Prompt Design:** The design of the prompt is crucial in zero-shot learning. You could experiment with different prompt structures, or add more context to help the model understand the task better. For instance, you could provide more details about the problem, or add examples of correct responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use a Different Language Model:** You can experiment with different language models provided by OpenAI (like `text-davinci-002`, `text-curie-003`, etc.). Some models might perform better on certain tasks based on their size and the data they were trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Class Balancing:** Although the Titanic dataset is balanced, in some cases where the dataset is imbalanced, you may want to ensure that the samples used for prediction are balanced. This is because language models can sometimes show a bias towards the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Tuning:** Although tuning is not typically part of a zero-shot learning setup (which aims to make predictions on unseen categories without any task-specific tuning), OpenAI does provide guidelines for fine-tuning their models. If zero-shot performance is not satisfactory, fine-tuning the model on a specific task could be an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ensembling:** Combining the predictions of multiple models or multiple runs of the same model can sometimes improve results. For instance, you could take the average of the scores from multiple models or runs, or use a majority voting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Post-Processing:** Depending on the task, some form of post-processing on the model's output might be beneficial. This could include applying a threshold to the output probabilities, or using a specific decision rule based on domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the effectiveness of these strategies can vary depending on the task and the specific characteristics of the data. Experimentation is often key to finding the best approach."

    "Improving the prompt design can indeed help the model understand the task better and consequently improve its performance. Here are some suggestions to improve the prompt for your specific task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add More Context:** You can add a brief explanation about the Titanic disaster at the beginning of the prompt to provide more context. This could help the model understand the significance of the features in predicting survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clarify the Problem:** Make it clear that the task is a binary classification problem and explain what each class means (i.e., 'Survived' and 'Did not Survive').\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Specify Feature Importance:** If certain features are more important than others in determining survival, you could mention this in the prompt.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision:** All three approaches have the same precision of 0.50, which means that when GPT-4 predicts a passenger to have survived, it is correct 50% of the time. This level of precision indicates a relatively high rate of false positive classifications (i.e., passengers predicted as survived but did not actually survive).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recall:** The recall for the first approach is perfect (1.00) meaning it identifies all actual 'Survived' instances correctly. However, for the improved prompt, the recall has slightly decreased to 0.98, regardless of the increase in sample size. This means that the improved prompt misses 2% of passengers who actually survived, both with 50 and 100 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **F1 Score:** The F1 scores are very close for all three approaches, with the first approach having a slightly higher score (0.67 vs. 0.66). The F1 score is a balance between precision and recall. The fact that the F1 score remained the same when increasing the sample size suggests that the model's performance remained consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, increasing the sample size didn't significantly change the performance of the model according to the metrics. The precision, recall, and F1 score remained similar to the smaller sample size. This could be due to the inherent difficulty of the task or the limitations of the model's capability to understand the context and make accurate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further strategies could involve trying different prompt designs, experimenting with different models or fine-tuning the model if it was possible, or incorporating other domain-specific knowledge into the prompt."

    "From the table, we can see that zero-shot in-context learning using GPT-4, even with an improved prompt and increased sample size, consistently achieved a precision of 0.50 and recall around 0.98 - 1.00, leading to an F1 Score around 0.66 - 0.67. This indicates that while the model was good at identifying most of the survivors (high recall), it was less accurate when it predicted a passenger survived (lower precision), which is why it has a lower F1 score.\n",

    "On the other hand, a well-tuned supervised learning model, such as XGBoost, can typically achieve higher precision, recall, and F1 scores (in the range of 0.70 - 0.85). This suggests that for this particular dataset and task, a supervised learning model might be a more effective choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that this doesn't diminish the value of zero-shot learning. Zero-shot learning is a powerful tool when we have little to no labeled data, or when we need to make predictions on tasks the model hasn't seen before. The trade-off is that it might not perform as well as traditional supervised learning on tasks where we do have plenty of labeled data, as in this case."

    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we explored zero-shot in-context learning with GPT-4 for our Titanic survival prediction problem. However, another learning paradigm exists that combines elements from zero-shot learning: few-shot learning. This method aims to make predictions after seeing only a handful of examples, hence its name. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the GPT-4 model, it refers to in-context learning, where the model makes predictions based on the conversation history provided, with a small set of examples included as part of the context. The structure of these examples, or 'shots', plays a crucial role in guiding the model to produce the desired output. These 'shots' could be seen as miniature lessons that teach the model how to perform a task without explicitly programming it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our Titanic survival prediction problem, the general structure of a prompt for few-shot learning would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "    prompt = (\n",
    "        \"I am a model trained to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. Here are some examples of my training:\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Example 1:\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Question: Given the following passenger information, is the passenger likely to have survived or not survived the Titanic disaster?\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Passenger Information: 'Class: 3, Sex: male, Age: 22'\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Answer: Not Survived\\n\"\n",
    "        \"...\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Now, a new example to classify:\\n\"\n",

    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to zero-shot learning, the model has never seen the specific task before during its training. However, unlike zero-shot learning, it is provided with a few examples of the task in the conversation history. This way, the model learns from these examples to make accurate predictions for the new instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is balanced, with 'Survived' and 'Not Survived' instances being almost equal. When creating our random sample for few-shot learning, we'll need to keep this class balance in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous sections, we will be using precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance of few-shot in-context learning. However, just like in zero-shot learning, AUC isn't applicable due to the inherent nature of the GPT-4 model. The following sections will dive deeper into the implementation and results of few-shot in-context learning with GPT-4."
