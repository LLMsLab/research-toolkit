    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP),\n",
    "various approaches exist to solve classification problems. Three\n",
    "commonly used methods are zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and\n",
    "traditional supervised learning. In this analysis, we aim to compare\n",
    "these approaches, particularly in the context of a text classification\n",
    "problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset and Classification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task revolves around the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, a public set\n",
    "of SMS labeled messages collected for mobile phone spam research. It\n",
    "includes a collection of more than 5,000 SMS messages, which have been\n",
    "manually labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham' (a term used to denote a\n",
    "non-spam message). The aim is to create models that can accurately\n",
    "classify new, unseen messages into these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Spam Classification Dataset:** The UCI Machine Learning Repository\n",
    "contains a SMS Spam Collection dataset that can be used for binary text\n",
    "classification: spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset is available\n",
    "[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue with Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One significant aspect of this dataset, and many real-world datasets, is\n",
    "class imbalance. That is, the number of 'ham' messages significantly\n",
    "outweighs the number of 'spam' messages. This imbalance can present\n",
    "challenges in model training, as models may become biased towards\n",
    "predicting the majority class. In our case, a model might lean towards\n",
    "predicting 'ham' more often as it could still achieve a seemingly high\n",
    "accuracy that way. We will address this issue and present strategies for\n",
    "handling such class imbalances in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Assessment Metrics and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of our models, we use three key metrics:\n",
    "Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Precision measures the proportion of\n",
    "true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while Recall\n",
    "(also known as Sensitivity) measures the proportion of true positives\n",
    "that were correctly identified. The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of\n",
    "Precision and Recall and gives us a single metric that takes both false\n",
    "positives and false negatives into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is often used as an\n",
    "evaluation metric, which depicts the model's performance across all\n",
    "classification thresholds. However, since we are using the OpenAI API\n",
    "for zero-shot and few-shot learning, and it does not provide the\n",
    "probability scores needed to compute the AUC, we will not use the AUC in\n",
    "this analysis. This limitation does not impact the efficacy of our\n",
    "comparison as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score offer robust measures to\n",
    "evaluate and compare the performance of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the dataset, problem, challenges, and evaluation metrics defined,\n",
    "our aim is to compare the efficacy of zero-shot learning, few-shot\n",
    "learning, and traditional supervised learning techniques in solving this\n",
    "text classification problem. This comparison will provide insights into\n",
    "the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and guide us towards the\n",
    "most suitable method for this particular task."

    "## Zero-Shot In-Context Learning Using GPT-4 Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of machine learning, in-context learning refers to a method\n",
    "where a model leverages contextual information to generate responses or\n",
    "predictions. In the case of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art transformer-based\n",
    "language model developed by OpenAI, it uses a context window to inform\n",
    "its output based on provided prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our scenario, we employ what is known as zero-shot learning in\n",
    "conjunction with in-context learning. Zero-shot learning is a type of\n",
    "machine learning where the model is asked to make predictions on data\n",
    "categories it has not explicitly seen during training. In other words,\n",
    "the model uses the generalized understanding it has developed during its\n",
    "pre-training phase to make predictions on unseen data. It is an\n",
    "appealing approach, especially in situations where labelled training\n",
    "data for specific tasks might be scarce or unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our task, a text classification problem involving\n",
    "categorizing SMS messages as 'spam' or 'ham', the prompt for zero-shot\n",
    "learning using GPT-4 takes the following general structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "    prompt = (\n",
    "        \"Question: Given the following content, is it of type A or type B?\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"Content: {content}\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Answer Choices: (A) Type A, (B) Type B.\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, 'Type A' corresponds to 'spam' and 'Type B' corresponds to\n",
    "'ham', and `{content}` represents the SMS message we want the model to\n",
    "classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge we faced when employing this approach was the class\n",
    "imbalance in our dataset. In our dataset, 'ham' messages significantly\n",
    "outnumber 'spam' messages. To give an idea of the imbalance,\n",
    "approximately 87% of the messages are 'ham', leaving only about 13% as\n",
    "'spam'. Such an imbalance can lead to a bias in model predictions, with\n",
    "the model favoring the majority class, in this case, 'ham'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, we utilized a balanced sample for model\n",
    "assessment. This was achieved by randomly sampling an equal number of\n",
    "'spam' and 'ham' messages, ensuring equal representation of both classes\n",
    "in our test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of zero-shot in-context learning with GPT-4 was\n",
    "evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Each metric provides\n",
    "insights into the model's performance considering both true positives\n",
    "and negatives, and false positives and negatives. Despite the OpenAI API\n",
    "limitations preventing us from calculating the AUC, these metrics\n",
    "provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the zero-shot\n",
    "in-context learning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, zero-shot in-context learning with GPT-4 offers an\n",
    "exciting approach to our text classification task, demonstrating\n",
    "versatility in handling class imbalances, and effectiveness in\n",
    "generalizing without explicit task-related training. However, as we will\n",
    "explore in the following sections, other learning methods can also be\n",
    "applied and compared to this task."

    "problem was evaluated using three metrics: precision, recall, and F1\n",

    "\n",
    "|       | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's interpret these results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision:** Precision is a measure of the model's accuracy considering only the predicted positive instances. In the context of our problem, a precision of 0.92 means that when GPT-4 predicts a message to be 'spam', it is correct 92% of the time. This level of precision indicates a relatively low rate of false positive classifications (i.e., 'ham' messages incorrectly classified as 'spam').\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recall:** Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. In our scenario, a recall of 0.97 means that the model identifies 97% of all actual 'spam' messages correctly. However, it also indicates a 3% rate of false negatives (i.e., 'spam' messages incorrectly classified as 'ham').\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **F1 Score:** The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it gives a balanced measure of these two metrics. An F1 score of 0.95 indicates a balance between precision and recall, demonstrating the model's robustness in handling both false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the GPT-4 model on this task is quite remarkable\n",
    "given it is a zero-shot learning scenario. However, we can further\n",

    "## Comparing In-Context Learning with Supervised Learning using LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we have employed two distinct methodologies for text\n",
    "classification, namely in-context learning using GPT-4 and a supervised\n",
    "learning approach using an LSTM model. Both of these methods have shown\n",
    "promising results, and now we aim to compare them and understand their\n",
    "differences and respective advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Context Learning with GPT-4\n",
    "\n",
    "In the in-context learning scenario, we used OpenAI's GPT-4, a\n",
    "state-of-the-art language model that utilizes Transformer-based neural\n",
    "networks. For this task, we trained GPT-4 with a few examples of spam\n",
    "and ham email contents and asked the model to predict whether a new\n",
    "email is spam or ham based on the content. We used the responses from\n",
    "GPT-4 to generate classification labels and evaluated the performance\n",
    "using precision, recall, and F1 score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of GPT-4 simplifies the process since it does not require\n",
    "explicit feature engineering or manual training of a machine learning\n",
    "model. The downside, however, is that GPT-4 is a black-box model with\n",
    "limited interpretability and could be sensitive to the prompt design and\n",
    "wording, which could potentially affect the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning using LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we employed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a\n",
    "type of recurrent neural network, in a supervised learning context.\n",
    "LSTMs are particularly useful for sequence prediction problems as they\n",
    "can store past information, making them ideal for text classification\n",
    "tasks like ours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our LSTM model was trained on preprocessed sequences of text from the\n",
    "emails and their corresponding labels (spam or ham). We used an\n",
    "Embedding layer for converting words to vectors, an LSTM layer for\n",
    "learning the sequences within the text, and a Dense layer for output. We\n",
    "then trained the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy\n",
    "loss function, given the binary nature of our classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM model has shown high precision, recall, and F1 Score,\n",
    "demonstrating its effectiveness in text classification tasks. However,\n",
    "it's worth noting that building and training the LSTM model required\n",
    "more effort compared to using GPT-4, including preprocessing the text\n",
    "data, designing the model architecture, and training and tuning the\n",
    "model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed that the dataset is imbalanced, with 'ham' messages\n",
    "significantly outnumbering 'spam' messages. This can cause the model to\n",
    "be biased towards the majority class, potentially leading to poor\n",
    "performance for the minority class. However, despite this potential\n",
    "issue, our LSTM model achieved high precision, recall, and F1 Score,\n",
    "indicating effective performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For models that are affected by class imbalance, strategies such as\n",
    "resampling the data, assigning class weights, or using different\n",
    "evaluation metrics can be applied. However, these strategies were not\n",
    "required in our case as the LSTM model demonstrated high performance\n",
    "despite the class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, both in-context learning with GPT-4 and supervised\n",
    "learning with LSTM have shown to be effective for our text\n",
    "classification task. The choice between these methods will depend on the\n",
    "specific requirements and constraints of your task, such as the\n",
    "availability of labeled data, computational resources, and the\n",
    "importance of model interpretability."

    "## Few-Shot In-Context Learning with GPT-4\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we explored both zero-shot in-context learning\n",
    "with GPT-4 and a supervised learning approach using an LSTM model for\n",
    "our SMS spam classification problem. However, another learning paradigm\n",
    "exists that combines elements from both: few-shot learning. This method\n",
    "aims to make predictions after seeing only a handful of examples, hence\n",
    "its name. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the GPT-4 model, it refers to in-context learning, where\n",
    "the model makes predictions based on the conversation history provided,\n",
    "with a small set of examples included as part of the context. The\n",
    "structure of these examples, or 'shots', plays a crucial role in guiding\n",
    "the model to produce the desired output. These 'shots' could be seen as\n",
    "miniature lessons that teach the model how to perform a task without\n",
    "explicitly programming it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our SMS spam classification problem, the general\n",
    "structure of a prompt for few-shot learning would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "    prompt = (\n",
    "        \"I am a model trained to identify spam and non-spam emails. Here are some examples of my training:\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Example 1:\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Question: Given the following email content, is the email spam or ham?\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Email Content: 'You have won a lottery! Claim your prize now.'\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Answer: Spam\\n\"\n",
    "        \"...\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Now, a new example to classify:\\n\"\n",
    "        \"Question: Given the following email content, is the email spam or ham?\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"Email Content: {msg}\\n\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to zero-shot learning, the model has never seen the specific\n",
    "task before during its training. However, unlike zero-shot learning, it\n",
    "is provided with a few examples of the task in the conversation history.\n",
    "This way, the model learns from these examples to make accurate\n",
    "predictions for the new instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that our dataset is unbalanced, with the 'ham'\n",
    "messages outnumbering the 'spam' messages. The proportion of each class,\n",
    "as mentioned before, is approximately 87% 'ham' and 13% 'spam'. When\n",
    "creating our random sample for few-shot learning, we'll need to keep\n",
    "this class imbalance in mind. While our previous approach addressed this\n",
    "issue by creating a balanced sample, few-shot learning might behave\n",
    "differently, and we may need to adjust our approach accordingly. We will\n",
    "explore the results and address any imbalance issues as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous sections, we will be using precision, recall, and F1\n",
    "score to assess the performance of few-shot in-context learning.\n",
    "However, just like in zero-shot learning, AUC isn't applicable due to\n",
    "the inherent nature of the GPT-4 model. The following sections will dive\n",
    "deeper into the implementation and results of few-shot in-context\n",
    "learning with GPT-4."
