## Welcome to Research Toolkit Repository

This repository, named "research-toolkit," serves as an open playground
for exploration and experimentation with a variety of toolkits,
methodologies, and cutting-edge technologies. Our purpose is to delve
into the fascinating world of AI, data science, and machine learning by
conducting small, digestible experiments. Ranging from testing the
functionality of a vector database, comparing classification models
using in-context learning and supervised learning, to experimenting with
various other methodologies, we aim to encapsulate a myriad of
explorations under one roof. This space encourages curiosity,
innovation, and learning, providing insights and hands-on experience
with multiple facets of the technology domain. Welcome aboard and happy
experimenting!

## Contributing

We welcome and appreciate all contributions. If you're interested in
contributing, please start by reading our
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

If you're new to the project or open source in general, we recommend
starting with issues labeled as ["Good First
Issue"](https://github.com/LLMsLab/qa-app-lab/issues/1). These issues
are typically more straightforward and a great way to get started with
the project.

Thank you for considering contributing to our project. We look forward
to working with you!

## Instructions

Before you begin, ensure you have installed Python 3. 

To start working on the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
$ cd your_repository
```

2. Create a Python virtual environment with venv:

```bash
$ make env_create
```

3. Depending on your operating system, activate the virtual environment using one of the following commands:

On macOS:

```bash
$ make env_activate_macos
```

On Windows:

```bash
$ make env_activate_windows
```

4. Install dependencies from a requirements.txt:

```bash
$ make env_install
```

5. Make the `src` folder a Python package:

```bash
$ make src_package
```

6. You are now ready to start working on the project. When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
$ make env_deactivate
```

Remember, every time you want to work on the project, ensure you
activate the virtual environment, and deactivate it when you're done.

This guide assumes that you are using make commands which have been properly defined in a Makefile for creating and managing the Python virtual environment, installing dependencies, and making the `src` directory a Python package.

If you aren't using a Makefile, replace the make commands with the
corresponding Python commands provided in previous responses.

> When you run the `make` command in the terminal, a menu is displayed that lists all the available options, from cleaning unused imports to creating a Python package, each associated with a specific command for easy management of your project workflow.
